#Weather React App
Weather Forecast, my first React App, implemented utilizing some sort of handy libraries for state management and Tailwind CSS to facilitate scaffolding process:
- Supporting library:
 + Remote state management: React Query
 + Router: React Router Dom
 + CSS Supporter: Tailwind CSS
- It's still under maintenance stage, UI hasn't been responsive for mobile and tablet devices. I have not concerned 'bout performance related issue, but soon updated it to a fresh one.
